#Simple Apps

These are small apps that we made in class to learn various concepts that Jo taught in class.  With many of these apps, we had homework assignments or spun them off into bigger apps.  

**BodyPartPlayground**:  This was a playground we made to practice making classes, variables, and initializers.

**Simple Buttons**:

**CalculatorFunctions**: This app helped us get comfortable with laying out items in Storyboard and using basic math functions.

**Tic Tac Toes/NewTic Tac Toes**: This Tic Tac Toe app introduced us to array, dictionaries, and collection types.  We also got some great experience drawing shapes in Core Graphics.

**High Priority**:  We learned about table views and reusable cells, and also practiced some basic drawing.  

**The Repository**: This app also focused on table view cells, getting them to display reusable data from an array.

**From Scratch**: We deleted the storyboard and created colorful, moving shapes out of UIViews using extensions, utilizing random numbers using the drand32

**Favorites**:  This app featured reusable table view cells and was our first experience using Parse.

**Github Friends**:  This app introduced us to the Github API, and we also used Fabric to implement Crashlytics over our reusable tableview of friends.

**Parse Login**:  We used Parse to create a login, save, and access the data.

**My World**:  This was a simple app we created to introduce Maps.  We learned how to use the Maps using MKMapView, and incorporated Crashlytics.

**Trial By Fire**:  This app was our introduction to Objective C, the first non-Swift app we made.

**Group Therapy**:  This Objective C app featured the Marvel API and gave us more experience using table views and reusable cells - as well as a lesson on multi-threading.

**Crazy Button**:  This was a small app we created to introduce Cocoapods.

**Album Art**:  This app introduced us to the iTunes API, which we used to make a Collection View of albums, with a detail view and song samples we could listen to using AVFoundation.

**Tomodachi Friends**:  I don't remember what this app does.

**Take A Selphie**:  This Objective C app was our first experience working with the camera through UIImagePicker's delegate/protocol.  We also learned how to apply filters.

**Pixel Adventure**:  This was our first experience using Sprite Kit.  We learned about nodes and implemented basic movements and attacks in our little game.

**Secrets**:  In this Objective C app, we worked with Parse and implemented push notifications, as well as worked through the process of getting a certificate for this feature. 

**FirebaseChat**:  This is an small app we made to introduce the Firebase SDK.  

**CoreNotes**: This is an app that introduces Core Data and shows a few simple ways in which it can be used.
